Lets go! 

----  
### Lessons Learned: 
day 1: 
- forgot about python Collections module with handy defaultdict and Counter dictionary subclasses.  Counter is useful here, just go ahead and count everything in right list and then you can just reference left list to see if it exists and if it does return the count

day 2: 
- sorted() function can be used in comparison operators
- map can be used rather than list comprehension to convert datatypes `list(map(int, line.split()))`
